# Task 2 - Practicing Git 2

## Task 2: GitHub Tutorial - Remote

Continuing with the [same tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org), complete the following modules:

- "Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8

- "To Origin And Beyond -- Advanced Git Remotes!"
  - Exercise 1
  - Exercise 2
  - Exercise 3
  - Exercise 4
  - Exercise 5
  - Exercise 6
  - Exercise 7
  - Exercise 8

Once you are done, you should include at most two screenshots - one from the "Main" tab (Task 1) and one from the "Remotes" (Task 2) tab.
Here is an example of the screenshot we are expecting, showing all 24 (8 from Task 1 and 16 from Task 2) in one screenshot.
To accomplish this, just take two screenshots (one for each tab), open them on your computer, and take a third screenshot with both of the images open - this is so you can submit just one screenshot so it'll be easier for the TAs to grade.

**You should put the screenshot(s) you want graded in the main lab directory (not within the `images` directory).**
